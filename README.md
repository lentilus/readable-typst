# Readable typst

> a collection of functions and show rules to make typst source code more readable. Ideally I would like to be able to write maths in plain text all together, without ever having to look at a generated pdf. I think typst's syntax is a really good starting point for that.

I would like the plain text representation of content to be close to notation common for written math.

To install. Clone the repo and run
```bash
mkdir -p .local/share/typst/packages/local/readable-code
ln -s /path/to/repo "x.y.z"
```

Then in your typst file import it with
```typst

```
